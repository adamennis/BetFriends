# BetFriends
BetFriends is a social media platform that allows you to make bets with your friends and automates the entire process. 
You can see what other bets your friends are making together and even opt to take on the challenge yourself.

You can chose how the bet gets closed, and even appoint a trusted person to pick a winner. The results of your bet will be displayed on a newsfeed for your friends to see.

The app is in its early stages and we've chosen to build our frontend with React, our backend using mainly Java and all of our infrastructe will be built on AWS using Terraform. Individual microservices will be packages into Docker images and either managed with Kubernetes or ECS.... we haven't got that far yet!
